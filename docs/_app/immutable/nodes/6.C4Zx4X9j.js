But achieving accurate, reliable semantic comparison requires careful processing at multiple levels. Here's exactly how it works inside the tool.</p> <p class="svelte-1apmzc4">The process begins the moment you paste code into either editor. Every change triggers an immediate recomputation using a highly optimized algorithm that runs entirely in your browser.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1apmzc4">Step 1: Line-by-Line Processing</h2> <p class="svelte-1apmzc4">First, both code inputs are split into individual lines. This preserves line number alignment while allowing independent processing of each line's content.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1apmzc4">Step 2: Normalization Pipeline</h2> <p class="svelte-1apmzc4">Each line goes through a two-stage normalization process. When "Ignore Case" is enabled, the entire line is converted to lowercase. This ensures that "UserID" and "userid" are treated as identical.</p> <p class="svelte-1apmzc4">When "Ignore Whitespace" is enabled, all sequences of whitespace characters — spaces, tabs, multiple spaces — are collapsed into single spaces. Leading and trailing whitespace is completely removed. This means four spaces of indentation become identical to one tab, which becomes identical to eight spaces.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1apmzc4">Step 3: Smart Array Comparison</h2> <p class="svelte-1apmzc4">After normalization, we have two arrays: one containing the processed lines from the left input, another from the right. These arrays are compared using a custom comparator that checks for exact string equality after normalization.</p> <p class="svelte-1apmzc4">The comparison algorithm identifies which lines are common, which were added, and which were removed. Importantly, lines that differ only in their original formatting but match after normalization are marked as common with a subtle gray highlight to show they were processed.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1apmzc4">Step 4: Visual Presentation</h2> <p class="svelte-1apmzc4">The final output preserves original line numbers and exact original content for display, while using the normalized comparison for determining changes. This means you see the actual code as written, but only meaningful differences are highlighted in red or green.</p> <p class="svelte-1apmzc4">Lines that required normalization to match appear with a gray background, providing transparency about what was ignored without distracting from real changes.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1apmzc4">Why This Approach Works</h2> <p class="svelte-1apmzc4">Unlike regex-based solutions that can misfire on complex code, this method is predictable and reliable. It handles edge cases like empty lines, trailing whitespace, and mixed indentation perfectly.</p> <p class="svelte-1apmzc4">The entire process completes in milliseconds even with thousands of lines because it avoids expensive character-by-character diffing when normalization makes lines identical.</p> <p class="italic-note svelte-1apmzc4">This foundation enables all the advanced use cases we'll explore in future posts.</p></article></div>`);function H(m){var e=_();b("1apmzc4",d=>{var s=w(),g=f(u(s),6);a(4),n(()=>l(g,"content",`${c??""}/blog/posts/post2`)),v(()=>{y.title="How Whitespace & Case Normalization Works Internally | Blog"}),i(d,s)});var t=r(e),h=r(t);a(4),o(t),a(2),o(e),n(()=>l(h,"href",`${c??""}/blog`)),i(m,e)}export{H as component,C as universal};
