Understanding when to enable whitespace and case ignoring — and when to disable it — is key to effective code review.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1li990r">Always Enable Both Toggles</h2> <p class="svelte-1li990r">Daily code reviews and pull requests are the primary use case. Most formatting changes come from automated tools or personal preference. Enabling both options eliminates noise and lets reviewers focus on logic, algorithms, and architecture.</p> <p class="svelte-1li990r">Refactoring sessions benefit enormously. When moving functions, extracting methods, or modernizing syntax, the core logic often remains identical. Semantic view reveals only the structural improvements.</p> <p class="svelte-1li990r">Technical interviews and pair programming sessions also shine with both toggles active. Candidates and interviewers can compare solutions without getting distracted by formatting differences.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1li990r">Keep One or Both Disabled</h2> <p class="svelte-1li990r">CSS and HTML comparisons often require exact whitespace preservation. Layout can depend on specific spacing, so disabling whitespace ignoring is safer here.</p> <p class="svelte-1li990r">When reviewing documentation or markdown files, case sensitivity matters. "Note" and "note" could have different meanings in some contexts.</p> <p class="svelte-1li990r">Security reviews sometimes need to see exact string matches. Attack payloads might differ only in case, and normalization could hide malicious variations.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1li990r">Hybrid Approach</h2> <p class="svelte-1li990r">Many teams use a two-step process. First, review with both toggles enabled to assess logical changes quickly. Then disable one or both to verify formatting consistency if required by project standards.</p> <p class="svelte-1li990r">This balanced workflow catches both semantic issues and style violations without sacrificing speed.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1li990r">Making the Right Choice</h2> <p class="svelte-1li990r">The tool shows gray highlighting for lines that matched only after normalization. This transparency helps reviewers understand exactly what was ignored. If too many lines appear gray, it might indicate over-normalization for the current task.</p> <p class="svelte-1li990r">Experienced teams develop intuition quickly. New developers learn faster when they can toggle settings and immediately see the impact.</p> <p class="italic-note svelte-1li990r">Great tools don't make decisions for you — they give you perfect information to make better ones.</p></article></div>`);function N(d){var e=k();b("1li990r",m=>{var a=_(),g=v(f(a),6);t(4),o(()=>l(g,"content",`${c??""}/blog/posts/post5`)),u(()=>{y.title="When to Use (and Not Use) Ignore Whitespace + Case | Blog"}),i(m,a)});var s=n(e),h=n(s);t(4),r(s),t(2),r(e),o(()=>l(h,"href",`${c??""}/blog`)),i(d,e)}export{N as component,B as universal};
