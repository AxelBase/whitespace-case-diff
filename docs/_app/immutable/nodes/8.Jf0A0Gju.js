Most online diff tools require you to upload both versions to their servers. Even if they promise not to store data, your code still travels over the internet and passes through third-party systems. For many teams and individuals, this is unacceptable.</p> <p class="svelte-led0iy">This tool works differently. Everything happens entirely in your browser. When you paste code and adjust settings, nothing is transmitted. Instead, the complete state — both code snippets and toggle settings — is compressed and encoded directly into the URL.</p> <h2 class="svelte-led0iy">How URL-Based Sharing Works</h2> <p class="svelte-led0iy">The moment you make a change, the browser history is updated with a new URL containing all necessary information. This uses a lightweight compression library that shrinks even large code blocks into a compact string safe for URLs.</p> <p class="svelte-led0iy">When you copy and share that link, the recipient opens it in their browser and sees exactly what you saw — identical code, same toggle states, same diff view — instantly. No server round-trip. No account required. No data ever leaves your control.</p> <h2 class="svelte-led0iy">Real-World Privacy Wins</h2> <p class="svelte-led0iy">This approach shines in sensitive situations. During technical interviews, candidates can compare their solution against the expected output without exposing proprietary test cases. Security teams can review patches containing confidential logic. Open-source maintainers can share before-and-after views of controversial refactors without risking leaks.</p> <p class="svelte-led0iy">Because the tool is fully static and deployable anywhere, companies can even host it internally on private networks for maximum security.</p> <h2 class="svelte-led0iy">Performance Benefits</h2> <p class="svelte-led0iy">Since no network request is needed to load shared diffs, opening a comparison link feels instantaneous. Even with thirty thousand characters of total code, the compressed URL remains under browser limits and loads immediately.</p> <p class="svelte-led0iy">The sharing mechanism also enables seamless collaboration. Multiple people can open the same link and discuss changes in real time, each seeing updates as others type.</p> <h2 class="svelte-led0iy">Why This Matters Now</h2> <p class="svelte-led0iy">Data breaches and privacy regulations have made developers increasingly cautious about where their code travels. At the same time, remote work has made quick, visual code sharing more important than ever. URL-based state solves both problems elegantly.</p> <p class="italic-note svelte-led0iy">True privacy doesn't require compromise — it requires smart design.</p></article></div>`);function q(p){var e=k();b("led0iy",m=>{var a=S(),y=v(u(a),6);t(4),o(()=>l(y,"content",`${c??""}/blog/posts/post4`)),g(()=>{f.title="Sharing Diffs Without Sending Code to Servers | Blog"}),i(m,a)});var s=r(e),h=r(s);t(4),n(s),t(2),n(e),o(()=>l(h,"href",`${c??""}/blog`)),i(p,e)}export{q as component,D as universal};
